# Changelog

## Version 0.6.3

- Add ability to upload any IO-like objects

## Version 0.6.2

- Don't modify the parsed response hash anymore. When Flickr is used with a
  memory cache, the response hash is hashed in memory. Because we were
  modifying this hash, this also modified the cached result, causing errors
  because of missing data.

## Version 0.6.1

- Remove the default timeout options, so the timeout will happen only if the
  user sets one.

- Make `Flickr::Object::Photo#size!` public.

- Allow uploading any kind of IO, not just files.

- Make `Flickr::Object::Photo#available_sizes` return only sizes that are
  actually available.

- Add `Flickr::Object::Set#photos` as an alias to `#get_photos`, to be
  consistent with other objects.

## Version 0.6.0

- Add license methods:

  ```
  flickr.photos.licenses.getInfo
  flickr.photos.licenses.setLicense
  ```

## Version 0.5.2

- Require Flickr errors, so that they're rescuable (thanks to @erik-eide)
- Make `Flickr::ApiError`'s message optional, so that it can be used by RSpec's
  `raise_error` matcher, without having to provide a second argument

## Version 0.5.1

- Generate different size's source URLs from photo's info
  ([docs](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/misc.urls.html)), if sizes are
  missing. That means that for some sizes ("Square 75" to "Large 1024")
  there is no need to pass in the `sizes: true` option.

## Version 0.5.0

- Add support for caching reponses.

## Version 0.4.1

- Flickr's API transferred to SSL, and the calls over http:// no longer work,
  so flickr-objects now makes calls always over SSL.

## Version 0.4.0

- Added `flickr.interestingness.getList`.
- Fixed `sizes: true` not applying to `flickr.photos.getContactsPublicPhotos` and
  `flickr.photos.recentlyUpdated`.

## Version 0.3.0

- The code has been thoroughly refactored, and fully
  [documented](http://rubydoc.info/github/janko-m/flickr-objects/master/frames). Yay!
- Removed `Flickr.api_methods` â€“ the consequences of its existence made the
  code uglier.
- Added `#find_by` and `#filter` to
  [`Flickr::Object::List`](http://rubydoc.info/github/janko-m/flickr-objects/master/Flickr/Object/List).
- You can now access the raw JSON response of a Flickr object with
  `#attributes`.
- Increased the default timeouts, so now the HTTP requests shouldn't timeout on
  normal internet connections

## Version 0.2.0

- Covered 17 more methods:

```
flickr.people.getPhotosOf
flickr.people.getUploadStatus

flickr.photos.getFavorites
flickr.photos.getNotInSet
flickr.photos.getRecent
flickr.photos.RecentlyUpdated
flickr.photos.getUntagged
flickr.photos.getWithGeoData
flickr.photos.getWithoutGeoData
flickr.photos.setDates
flickr.photos.setMeta
flickr.photos.setPerms
flickr.photos.setSafetyLevel

flickr.photosets.editMeta
flickr.photosets.orderSets
flickr.photosets.reorderPhotos
flickr.photosets.setPrimaryPhoto
```

## Version 0.1.0

- On objects that have an ID, `#==` will now compare their IDs (useful when you
  get the same object from different sources)
- Implemented dynamic finders (`#find_by_<attribute>`) on `Flickr::List`.
- Implemented authentication. Take a look at [this
  wiki](https://github.com/janko-m/flickr-objects/wiki/Authentication).
- Removed videos completely. Too much hacking, because Flickr's API doesn't have
  a good support for them.
- Implemented smart size methods. Take a look at [this wiki](https://github.com/janko-m/flickr-objects/wiki/Sizes)
- Implemented pagination. Supports both Will Paginate and Kaminari. Take a look
  at [this wiki](https://github.com/janko-m/flickr-objects/wiki/Configuration),
  under "Pagination" for how to enable it.
